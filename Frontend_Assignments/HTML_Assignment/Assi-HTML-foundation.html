    <!-- Website -->
        <h1>Website</h1>
    <p>A website is <strong> a collection of files accessed through a web address, covering a particular theme or
            subject,
            and managed by a particular person or organization.</strong> Its opening page is called a home page.</p>
    <p> <strong> A website is a collection of publicly accessible, interlinked Web pages that share a single domain
            name.
            Websites can be created and maintained by an individual, group, business or organization to serve a
            variety
            of purposes.</strong> Together, all publicly accessible websites constitute the World Wide Web. <br>
        <br>
        Although it is sometimes called “web page,” this definition is wrong, since a website consists of several
        webpages. A website is also known as a “web presence” or simply “site”.

    <!-- WWW- World Wide Web -->
        <h1>WWW- World Wide Web</h1>
    <p>- Known as a web.
        - Is a collenction of website or web pages stored in web servers. <br>
        - Connected to local computers through the internet. <br>
        - These websites contain text pages, digital images, audios, videos, etc. <br>
        - Users can access the content of these sites from any part of the world using computers, laptops, cell
        phones,
        etc. <br>
        - The WWW, along with internet, enables the retrieval and display of text and media to your device. <br>
    </p>
    <h2>WWW - How internet works?
    </h2>
    <p>- A server is where websites are stored, and it works a lot like your computer's hard drive. <br>
        - Once the request arrives, the server retrieves the website and sends the correct data back to your
        computer.
        <br>
        - One of the best features of the internet is the ability to communicate almost instantls with anyone in the
        world. <br>
        - Email is one of the oldest and most universal ways to communicate and share information on the internet,
        and
        bilions of people use it. Social media allows people to connect in a variety of ways and build communities
        online. <br>

    <!-- HTTP/HTTPS -->
    <h1>HTTP/HTTPS</h1>
    <h2>HTTP</h2>
    <p>HTTP stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol. It is a protocol used for communication between web browsers and
        web
        servers. HTTP allows the transfer of hypertext, which includes HTML documents, images, videos, and other
        resources, over the internet. <br> <br>

        When you type a URL (Uniform Resource Locator) into a web browser, such as Chrome or Firefox, the browser
        sends
        an HTTP request to the web server hosting that URL. The server then responds to the request, sending back
        the
        requested data, typically in the form of an HTML document. <br> <br>

        HTTP follows a client-server model, where the client (typically a web browser) initiates a request to the
        server, and the server responds with the requested data or an error message. The communication between the
        client and the server happens over a TCP/IP connection.</p> <br> <br>
    <h2>HTTPS</h2>
    <p>HTTPS stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure. It is a protocol used for secure communication over a
        computer network, most commonly the internet. HTTPS is the secure version of HTTP, which is the protocol
        used
        for transferring data between a web browser and a website. <br> <br>

        The primary purpose of HTTPS is to provide encryption and secure authentication of the website that users
        are
        connecting to. It ensures that the data exchanged between the browser and the website remains confidential
        and
        cannot be intercepted or tampered with by attackers. <br> <br>

        HTTPS uses SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) or TLS (Transport Layer Security) protocols to encrypt the data. When
        a
        user connects to a website over HTTPS, their browser and the website's server establish a secure connection
        by
        exchanging SSL/TLS certificates. These certificates verify the authenticity of the website and enable the
        encryption of data transmitted between the two parties.</p> <br> <br>

    <!-- Client-Server -->
    <h1>Client-Server</h1>
    <p>A client-server architecture is a common model used in computer networking and distributed systems. In this
        architecture, the communication and interaction between devices are divided into two main roles: the client
        and
        the server. <br></p>
    <p>
    <h2>Clinet- server communication </h2>
    <h3> 1. Client "sometimes on" </h3>
    - Intiates a request to the server when interested <br>
    - Ex. web browser on your laptop or cell phone <br>
    - Doesn't communicate directly with other clients <br>
    - needs to know the server's address <br> <br>

    <h3>2. Server is "always on"</h3>
    - Services requests frome many client hosts <br>
    - Ex. Wev server for the www.example.com web site <br>
    - Doesn't initiate contract with the clients <br>
    - Needs a fixed, well-known address <br> <br>
    </p> <br> <br>
    <hr>

       <!-- Path -->
       <h1>Path</h1>
       <p>In web development, a "path" typically refers to the specific location or route within a website or web
           application. <strong>It is part of the URL (Uniform Resource Locator) </strong> that specifies the location
           of a
           particular resource or page on a server. <br> <br>

           A path is represented as a string of characters that comes after the domain name in a URL. It helps the
           server
           identify the specific resource or page that the user is requesting. For example, in the URL <strong>
               <ins> "https://www.example.com/products/category1/item1"</ins> </strong>, the path
           "/products/category1/item1" represents the
           specific path to the item1 page within the category1 section of the products on the example.com website.</p>
       <br> <br>
       <hr>

       <!-- Extension -->
       <h1>Extension</h1>
       <p>A filename extension, file name extension or file extension is a suffix to the name of a computer file
           <strong> (e.g.,
               .txt, .docx, .md).</strong> The extension indicates a characteristic of the file contents or its
           intended use. A
           filename extension is typically delimited from the rest of the filename with a full stop (period), but in
           some
           systems it is separated with spaces. Other extension formats include dashes and/or underscores on early
           versions
           of Linux and some versions of IBM AIX. <br> <br>

           Some file systems implement filename extensions as a feature of the file system itself and may limit the
           length
           and format of the extension, while others treat filename extensions as part of the filename without special
           distinction.

       <!-- URL-URI/URN -->
       <h1>URL-URI/URN</h1>
       <h2>URL</h2>
       <h3>Defination of URL</h3>
       <p> <strong> A URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is a unique identifier used to locate a resource on the
               Internet.</strong> It is
           also referred to as a web address. URLs consist of multiple parts -- including a protocol and domain name --
           that tell a web browser how and where to retrieve a resource.</p>
       <p>
       <h3> URL -- Uniform Resource Locator</h3>
       Contains information about how to fetch a resource from its location. For example: <br> <br>

       <strong><ins> http://example.com/mypage.html <br> <br>
               ftp://example.com/download.zip <br> <br>
               mailto:user@example.com <br> <br>
               file:///home/user/file.txt <br> <br>
               http://example.com/resource?foo=bar#fragment <br> <br>
               /other/link.html (A relative URL, only useful in the context of another URL)</ins> <br> <br></strong>
       <strong> URLs always start with a protocol (http)</strong> and usually contain information such as <strong> the
           network host name
           (example.com) </strong>and often <strong>a document path (/foo/mypage.html). </strong> URLs may have query
       parameters and
       fragment identifiers.</p> <br>


       <h3> URN -- Uniform Resource Name</h3>
       <p> Identifies a resource by name. It always starts with the prefix <strong>urn:</strong> For example: <br> <br>

           <strong> urn:isbn:0451450523 </strong>to identify a book by its ISBN number. <br> <br>
           <strong>urn:uuid:6e8bc430-9c3a-11d9-9669-0800200c9a66</strong> a globally unique identifier <br> <br>
           <strong>urn:publishing:book</strong> - An XML namespace that identifies the document as a type of book. <br>
           <br>
           URNs can identify ideas and concepts. They are not restricted to identifying documents. When a URN does
           represent a document, it can be translated into a URL by a "resolver". The document can then be downloaded
           from
           the URL.
       </p>
       <h3>URI -- Uniform Resource Identifier</h3>
       <p>URIs encompasses both URLs, URNs, and other ways to indicate a resource. <br> <br>

           An example of a URI that is neither a URL nor a URN would be a data URI such as <strong>
               data:,Hello%20World.</strong> It
           is not a URL or URN because the URI contains the data. It neither names it, nor tells you how to locate it
           over
           the network. <br> <br>

           There are also uniform resource citations (URCs) that point to meta data about a document rather than to the
           document itself. An example of a URC would be an indicator for viewing the source code of a web page:
           <strong>view-source:<ins>http://example.com/</ins></strong> . A URC is another type of URI that is neither
           URL nor URN.
       </p> <br> <br>
       <h3>Deferance between URL, URI and URN</h3>
       <p>URI (uniform resource identifier) identifies a resource (text document, image file, etc) URL (uniform
           resource
           locator) is a subset of the URIs that include a network location. URN (uniform resource name) is a subset of
           URIs that include a name within a given space, but no location.</p> <br> <br>

       <!-- Address bar -->
       <h1>Address bar</h1>
       <p>The address bar is <strong> the familiar text field at the top of a web browser's graphical user interface
               (GUI) that
               displays the name or the URL (uniform resource locator) of the current web page.</strong> Users request
           websites
           and pages by typing either the name or the URL into the address bar. <br> <br>The term address bar refers to
           the
           text field in a web browser that identifies the user's location on the web and allows them to access
           different
           websites. The address bar is known as a location bar, and in Google Chrome, it's called the omnibox. </p>

       <!-- Title bar -->
       <h1>Title bar</h1>
       <P>The title bar at the top of a window <strong> displays an application-defined icon and line of text.</strong>
           The text
           specifies the name of the application and indicates the purpose of the window. The title bar also makes it
           possible for the user to move the window using a mouse or other pointing device.</P>
