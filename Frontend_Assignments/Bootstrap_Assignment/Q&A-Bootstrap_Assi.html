    <h2>2. What is a Bootstrap Container, and how does it work?</h2>
    <p>
      Containers are the most basic layout element in Bootstrap and are required
      when using our default grid system. Containers are used to contain, pad,
      and (sometimes) center the content within them. While containers can be
      nested, most layouts do not require a nested container.

    <!-- Q-7 -->
    <h2>7. How can you use Bootstrap to make thumbnails?</h2>
    <p>
      Step 1:- The first step is to include the Bootstrap and jQuery CDN into
      the head tag before having CSS's stylesheets. <br />

      Step 2:- We need to create a div tag in our HTML body. We will create
      three div sections for each image in this div tag. <br />

      Step 3:- We can add various col properties for making our page responsive,
      like col-sm-6 or col-md-3. <br />

      Step 4:- You need to create an anchor tag &lt;a&gt;, with a class name -
      .thumbnail wrapped around an image tag.

    <!-- Q-8 -->
    <h2>8. In Bootstrap 4, what is flexbox?</h2>
    <p>
      Flexbox. The biggest difference between Bootstrap 3 and Bootstrap 4 is
      that Bootstrap 4 now uses flexbox, instead of floats, to handle the
      layout. The Flexible Box Layout Module, makes it easier to design flexible
      responsive layout structure without using float or positioning.
