    <h2>1. What is JavaScript?</h2>
    <p>JavaScript is a text-based programming language used both on the client-side and server-side that allows you to
        make web pages interactive. Where HTML and CSS are languages that give structure and style to web pages,
        JavaScript gives web pages interactive elements that engage a user</p>

    <h2>2. What is the use of isNaN function?</h2>
    <p>The JavaScript isNaN() Function is used to check whether a given value is an illegal number or not. It returns
        true if the value is a NaN else returns false.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>3. What is negative Infinity?</h2>
    <p>NEGATIVE_INFINITY is a special numeric value that is returned when an arithmetic operation or mathematical
        function generates a negative value greater than the largest representable number in JavaScript i.e., more
        negative than -Number.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>4. Which company developed JavaScript?</h2>
    <p>
    <h3>Netscape Communications <br></h3>
    JavaScript was created at Netscape Communications by Brendan Eich in 1995. Netscape and Eich designed JavaScript as
    a scripting language for use with the company's flagship web browser, Netscape Navigator.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>5. What are undeclared and undefined variables?</h2>
    <p>Undefined: It occurs when a variable has been declared but has not been assigned any value. Undefined is not a
        keyword. Undeclared: It occurs when we try to access any variable that is not initialized or declared earlier
        using the var or const keyword.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>6. Write the code for adding new elements dynamically?
    </h2>
    <p>Syntax: document.createElement("<tagName>"); // Where <tagName> can be any HTML // tagName like div, ul, button,
                etc. // newDiv element has been created For Eg: let newDiv = document.createElement("div");</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>7. What is the difference between ViewState and SessionState?
    </h2>
    <p>The basic difference between these two is that the ViewState is to manage state at the client's end, making state
        management easy for end-user while SessionState manages state at the server's end, making it easy to manage
        content from this end too. ViewState: It is maintained at only one level that is page-level.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>8. What is === operator?
    </h2>
    <p>The strict equality ( === ) operator checks whether its two operands are equal, returning a Boolean result.
        Unlike the equality operator, the strict equality operator always considers operands of different types to be
        different.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>9. How can the style/class of an element be changed?</h2>
    <p>style property is represented by the CSSStyleDeclaration object, which is returned via the style property. Select
        the element whose style properties need to be changed. Use element. style property to set the style attribute of
        an element.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>10. How to read and write a file using JavaScript?</h2>
    <p>1. file=fopen(getScriptPath(),0); The function fread() is used for reading the file content. <br>
        2. str = fread file,flength(file) ; The function fwrite() is used to write the contents to the file. <br>
        3. file = fopen("c:\MyFile.txt", 3);// opens the file for writing.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <h2>11. What are all the looping structures in JavaScript?
    </h2>
    <p>1. for - loops through a block of code a number of times <br>
        2. for/in - loops through the properties of an object <br>
        3. for/of - loops through the values of an iterable object <br>
        4. while - loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true <br>
        5. do/while - also loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true <br></p>
    <hr>
    <h2>12. How can you convert the string of any base to an integer in JavaScript?
    </h2>
    <p>In JavaScript parseInt() function (or a method) is used to convert the passed-in string parameter or value to an
        integer value itself. This function returns an integer of the base which is specified in the second argument of
        the parseInt() function.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>13. What is the function of the delete operator?
    </h2>
    <p>The delete operator removes a property from an object. If the property's value is an object and there are no more
        references to the object, the object held by that property is eventually released automatically</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>14. What are all the types of Pop up boxes available in JavaScript?</h2>
    <p>There are three types of pop-up boxes in JavaScript namely Alert Box, Confirm Box and Prompt Box.</p>

    <h2>15. What is the use of Void (0)?
    </h2>
    <p>“javascript: void(0)” is similar to void. javascript: void(0) means return undefined as a primitive value. We use
        this to prevent any negative effects on a webpage when we insert some expression. For example, in the case of
        URL hyperlinks</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>16. How can a page be forced to load another page in JavaScript?</h2>
    <p>Approach: We can use window. location property inside the script tag to forcefully load another page in
        Javascript. It is a reference to a Location object that is it represents the current location of the document.
        We can change the URL of a window by accessing it.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>17. What are the disadvantages of using innerHTML in JavaScript?</h2>
    <p>Event handlers attached to any DOM element are preserved. <br>
        Replacement is done everywhere. <br>
        It is not possible to append innerHTML. <br>
        Breaks the document. <br>
        Used for Cross-site Scripting.</p>

            } else {
